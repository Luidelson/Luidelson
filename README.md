# Hey there 👋 I'm Luidelson

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a software engineer with one year of experience, transitioning from a business background into tech. I’ve always been surrounded by technology, and finally decided to dive in—and i dont regret it whatsoever. Now I build web apps, APIs, and creative tools that solve real-world problems. Glad you stopped by 🚀
